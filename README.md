 Data Exploration &amp; Preparation Programme : L7 Dip. in Data Analytics

In the digital age, the constant deluge of unsolicited and often malicious electronic messages—known universally as "Spam"—has evolved into a major issue, impacting everything from productivity to cybersecurity. Spam filters are no longer a luxury; they have become a fundamental necessity across all aspects of life, silently guarding our inboxes.

This report is a deep dive into this persistent problem, utilizing a real-life dataset: the SPAM E-mail Database. The data set attached is a real-life example of emails that have been sent to a company and have been labelled as True (is spam) and False (not spam).

Our objective is to become the "data detective," investigating this corpus to understand the subtle linguistic and structural cues that give a spam email away. This journey begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure, clean and prepare the dataset for modeling, and uncover critical features associated with spam. Following this, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction, to distill the most significant predictive information into a compact feature set, preparing the data for a lean and effective classification model.
